The course is conducted by the FabLab section of MESCE and was commenced on 2nd August 2017 Wednesday. The course is lead by [Mr. Muhammed Jaseel](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/390/), an ambitious man , who descriptively explained about the scopes of FabLab, CNC, and 3D Printing. By the end, simple assignments were given to the students.

Actually "FabLab - MESCE‚Äù is digital manufacturing technology, combininig 2D and 3D design with the latest fabrication technology. Embracing a broad spectrum of methods ranging from CNC machining to 3D printing, and even PCB Milling. It can produce a single unique product from a digital design in a matter of minutes- and at a very low cost in comparison to traditional tooling methods.

Today is my first day in MES Fablab. First our beloved Shine Sir, who is having the charge of the lab speak about the Fablab and introduced [Mr.Jaseel](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtrivandrum/students/390/). He spoke about the fabrication,describe about the lab,machines ect.

As every machines are CNC, we had a detailed discussion on Computer Numerical Controll.Computer numerical control (CNC) is the automation of machine tools by means of computers executing pre-programmed sequences of machine control commands.[1] This is in contrast to machines that are manually controlled by hand wheels or levers, or mechanically automated by cams alone.[For more information click here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control)

He asked us to install Cura,Eagle,Autocad,Solidworks,Rhino,Google Sketchup and Tinkercad. He also asked us join in [Github](https://github.com/),which is used for documentation purpose.

He also speak about Instructable, Thingivers, Pinshape, My Mini Factory, etc from which we can get several designs.
